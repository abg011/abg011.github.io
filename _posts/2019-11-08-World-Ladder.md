### Problem
Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:

##### Only one letter can be changed at a time
##### Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary
##### If there are multiple such sequence of shortest length, return all of them. Refer to the example for more details.

P.S. - **_Print all possible paths_**

Note:

_All words have the same length._

_All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters._
