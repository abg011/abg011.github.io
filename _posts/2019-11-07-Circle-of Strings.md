## Optimal Strategy For a Game
### Problem
Given an array of strings A[], determine if the strings can be chained together to form a circle. A string X can be chained together with another string Y if the last character of X is same as first character of Y. If every string of the array can be chained, it will form a circle.

For eg for the array arr[] = {"for", "geek", "rig", "kaf"} the answer will be Yes as the given strings can be chained as "for", "rig", "geek" and "kaf"
