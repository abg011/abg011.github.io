### Problem
Given a number N, calculate the count of numbers in {1, 2, 3,..., N} that are relatively prime to N.

### Solution

## Euler's Totient Function
- Gives the number of coprime numbers less tha a given number.

Algorithm is as follows-
- Initialize result as N
- For every number from 2 to phi(N)[Totient Function Value], divide N until it indivisible by it ans remove those numbers from result i.e.(result-=result/p).
- If reduced N is >1, remove all the multiples of N from the result too.
